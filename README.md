INTRODUCTION
------------

This repo is a demonstration of the jQueryUI sortable widget and slider widget, as well as a teaching tool to see the effect of saturation and lightness on colors.

The user can:
    * Move around colored items in a grid. 
    * Increase or decrease the saturation and lightness of the items using sliders and see the changes real-time.

SETUP
-----------

    * Clone this repo
    * Run the files using a server (I use a basic python server)
    Note: the server is necessary because this contains links to jQuery and Bootstrap files 
    - it needs internet access.
